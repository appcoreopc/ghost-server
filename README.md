Rules for this repo.

1. Avoid using a transpiler when possible.
2. Use `let` instead of `const` or `var`
3. Use `require` instead of `import`
4. Use the .prettierrc from the root directory
5. Use project-repl for each subproject
6. Make sure everything can be installed by just doing `yarn` in any recent officially supported version of node.
